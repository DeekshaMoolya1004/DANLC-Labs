Data Visualization & Advanced Excel Formulas - Anudip Foundation for Data Analytics
Welcome to my repository showcasing the Data Visualization and Advanced Excel Formula projects, completed as part of the Anudip Foundation for Data Analytics course. In this repository, you'll find a collection of labs and exercises designed to enhance data analysis skills using Excel and data visualization techniques.

ðŸš€ Projects Overview
This repository is organized into two main sections:

Data Visualization:

In this section, I delve into the world of data visualization, leveraging powerful libraries like Matplotlib to create various types of plots, including line charts, bar plots, pie charts, and histograms. These visualizations help transform raw data into clear, insightful graphics that drive decision-making.
Advanced Excel Formulas:

The labs in this section cover advanced Excel techniques and formulas to manipulate and analyze data efficiently. Key skills include using VLOOKUP, INDEX-MATCH, pivot tables, conditional formatting, and more, enabling complex data manipulation and insights extraction directly within Excel.
ðŸ“Š Key Skills Developed
Data Visualization with Matplotlib and other Python libraries
Advanced Excel Formulas and Functions (VLOOKUP, INDEX-MATCH, Pivot Tables)
Data analysis techniques to work with large datasets
